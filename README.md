# Machine_Learning

This repository contains Machine Learning programs written in Python. The programs are provided in two formats: **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)** for interactive learning and **Python (.py)** files for direct execution. The repository is organized so that notebook files and Python codes are stored in separate folders for better clarity and ease of use.

## Features

- Machine Learning programs in `.ipynb` and `.py` formats
- Separate folders for notebooks and Python programs
- Covers basic to intermediate Machine Learning concepts
- Useful for learning, practice, and academic purposes

## Prerequisites

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository** to your local machine:
   bash
   https://github.com/Rishikeshgawali/Machine_Learning

2. **Run Jupyter Notebook Files**:

   bash
   jupyter notebook

   Open the required `.ipynb` file from the notebook folder.

3. **Run Python Files**:

   bash
   python filename.py

## How it Works

1. The repository stores Machine Learning programs in two formats.
2. `.ipynb` files allow step-by-step execution with explanations and visualizations.
3. `.py` files allow direct execution of Machine Learning programs from the command line.
4. Users can choose the format based on their learning or execution preference.

## Example

To run a Python program:

bash
python linear_regression.py

To run a notebook:

bash
jupyter notebook linear_regression.ipynb
